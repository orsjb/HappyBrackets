/**
 * basic FM wave generating a carrier frequency with a depth of 50% of the carriet frequency
 * We will use an envelope to change the carrier frequency
 * Modulating at a rate of 0.4Hz
 * We will be using a function to calculate the frequency the carrier wavePlayer needs to be at
 * This time we will make it Modulator a square wave
 * Hold the carrier frequency low with carrierFrequency envelope segment for 5 seconds.
 * The carrier will modulate, switching between 2/3 of carrier frequency to 4/3 of carrier
 *
 * The carrier will move to high frequency after the hold based on carrierFrequency envelope segment
