*******************************************************************
[events]     - Different types of events that can be used
  [clocks]   - Perform actions on clock based events
    SimpleClock             Plays a chromatic scale using a clock.
                            Uses Midi to Frequency function to convert a MIDI note number to a frequency

    VariableClock           Uses an envelope to modify the speed of a clock. Plays a whole tone scale
    SensorControlledClock   Uses the values of an accelerometer to vary the speed of a clock

  [envelope] - Perform actions based on events that occur when an envelope segment completes
    EnvelopeTrigger         Plays three layers of sound, with each layer commencing after a segment completes

*******************************************************************
[midi] - Generate waveforms based on Midi note numbers
  [basic]   - very simple examples
    SimpleMidi          Converts a Midi note number to a frequency to generate playback
    MajorChord          Uses Pitch class to obtain major third and perfect fifth Midi numbers
                        The numbers are converted to frequencies and played together
    MinorChord          Uses Pitch class to obtain minor third and perfect fifth Midi numbers
                        The numbers are converted to frequencies and played together

  [scales]  -  Scale generation based on Midi note numbers
    MajorScale          Uses a clock to increment a counter. The index is converted to the Midi note number
                        based on the scale degree of the major scale using Pitch class, converted to a frequency and played

    CustomScale         A custom scale based on Midi note numbers is defined and mapped. A clock increments a counter.
                        The index is converted to appropriate Midi note number defined in the custom scale mapping.
                        The Midi note number is converted to a frequency and played

*******************************************************************
