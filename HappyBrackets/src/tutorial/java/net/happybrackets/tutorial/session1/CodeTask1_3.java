 *
 * This task involves for-loops. It is assumed you have enough coding experience to know how to make one. If you're not sure, take a look at the supporting material to see where you can learn about basic principles of Java programming.
 *
 * Using the example code, add an integer variable N that specifies the number of oscillators, and then write a for-loop that creates N oscillators.
 *
 * Be sure to also regulate the volume to account for the fact that many oscillators will be louder than 1!
 *
 * Try this with 10 or 100 oscillators.
 *
 * The number 50 below dictates the random spread of the oscillator detune. See what happens when you vary this.
