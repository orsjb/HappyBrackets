/**
 * Created by ollie on 6/06/2016.
 *
 * Run the code below and see how the group of samples is being loaded.
 *
 * There are two things that could be improved with this code.
 *
 * Firstly, the sound distorts because when too many samples are played, we get too loud. Adjust the volume of the guitar plucks to alleviate this.
 * Secondly, the random repetition of sounds (the same note played twice in a row) does not sound nice. Introduce a fix that stops notes repeating.
 *
 * Also introduce random variation to the volume of the guitar plucks.
 * Now introduce random pitch bend on the end of notes.
 *
